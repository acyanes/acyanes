### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mixr & an interpreter.
- :sunglasses: Mostly interested in full-stack applications, performance and optimizations.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Anything in my github is outside my 9-5. I enjoy tinkering with different tech even if I don't complete a full project. The reality is if I am not interested, then I am not going to code outside of work.
